<!-- Introduction -->
## Introduction
This project is a test and demonstration of WebGL with JS 3. It involves designing and constructing a simple village using WebGL. The village consists of various elements such as a water tank, a barn, and trees. The project also includes buttons and sliders for interactive features like rotation and zooming.

<!-- Project Structure -->
## Project Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that displays the WebGL scene.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the HTML elements.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the WebGL code and logic.
- `textures/`: Directory containing textures used in the project.
- `screenshots/`: Directory to store screenshots of the running program.

<!-- Features -->
## Features
- Water Tank: A cylinder-shaped water tank is rendered in the scene.
- Barn: A rectangular structure with a prism roof represents a barn.
- Trees: Trees are rendered using cylinders for trunks and cones for the top half of the tree.
- Ground and Water Pond: The ground is defined, and a water pond is drawn on the ground.
- Buttons:
  - Toggle Rotation: Starts and stops the rotation of shapes in the village.
  - Toggle Direction: Changes the direction of rotation.
- Sliders:
  - Speed Control: Increases or decreases the speed of rotation of shapes.
  - Zoom Control: Allows zooming in or out to the center of the village.

<!-- Usage -->
## Usage
To run the WebGL village project, follow these steps:
1. Download the project ZIP folder and extract it to a local directory.
2. Open the extracted folder in a code editor or IDE.
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
4. The WebGL village scene will be displayed, and you can interact with the buttons and sliders as described in the features section.
